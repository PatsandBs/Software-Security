# Software-Security


**•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
We are Global Rain, a software engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development. We believe “Security is everyone’s responsibility.” 

Artemis Financial is a client of ours. They are a consulting company that develops custom financial plans for their customers based on each customer’s specific wants and needs. These financial plans include savings, retirement, investment, and insurance plans.

Artemis Financial want their software to have the most up-to-date and effective software security. They would like our, Global Rain’s, expertise on how to protect their company and their software from external threats. 

**•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**
We will review Artemis Financials’ web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities. We will, then, document them and their remediations in a vulnerability assessment report. 

Customers’ private information as well as their financial data is used and stored in the application and their databases, so secure communications are absolutely essential. With this being a web-based application, customers should be able to access their accounts from anywhere in the world, so the necessary regulations must be in place to comply with all policies that involve international transactions. 

**•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**
It was a little challenging reading through the vulnerability report. There was an excessive amount of information that I had never encountered before. Dependency checks seem to be a vital operation especially for applications that use lots of frameworks and external APIs.

**•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**


**•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**


**•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**


**•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**
